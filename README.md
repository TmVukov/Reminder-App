## Project Basic Info

Project is built with React and Firebase. Also, some third-party packages are used:

‣ Framer Motion

‣ react-calendar

‣ react-time-picker

‣ react-icons

‣ react-color

Link to the project is in the "About" section.

• When clicked don't be afraid, there is a small bouncing icon in bottom right corner. Click on it. :)

• Now add basic Reminder info (title & description). 

• Pick some color for your reminder.

• Pick date and time.

• Start alarm.

• Save reminder - it should appear on the right.

• You can also edit title or description in your Reminder, in case you messed up. :)

• Wait for your notification - it should appear in the top right corner. 

• Multiple reminders are possible but alarms have to be unique.
